# Simple Message Protocol

This project is meant to only take an evening to complete, and is heavily inspired by other projects I have done recently using the new [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) family of crates. It's primary purpose is to be a code sample, with a secondary purpose of building expertise creating fast, reliable, asynchronous servers.
